We are the Orlando Devs, a community of software developers in Orlando who are life-long learners and love being around like-minded people all day.

We do that by hanging out on the [Orlando Devs Slack channel]({{ site.baseurl }}/slack) every day, and by going to multiple [meetups throughout the month](https://meetup.com). We even have [our own monthly meetup]({{ site.baseurl }}/meetup) where we cover a wide array of topics that are related to software development.

Jacques Fu

Jenell Pizarro

We hope that you will join us soon, be on the Orlando Devs Slack, Orlando Devs Meetup, or all the other software-related meetups happening in Orlando.

Have a blast! ðŸš€
