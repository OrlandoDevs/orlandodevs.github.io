# Getting Started

This project uses `jekyll` which means you will need to have a ruby dev environment setup. See what version of ruby is required in either `.ruby-version` or `Gemfile`.

You can run the `ensure_env_bootstrapped.sh` script to automatically check if your environment appears to be installed correctly. This is only needed to be run once successfully, but there is no harm in re-running it. Once you have your environment configured you just need to `bundle exec jekyll serve` to start developing.

If you run into any issues with the bootstrapping script, please reach out for help on slack so that we can update the script for future devs.
