The Orlando Devs Community exists to improve the quality of life of software developers in Orlando, FL. One of the ways we're able to fulfill that mission is to share an independent annual salary survey that sheds light on the salaries of software developers of various skill levels and years of tenure in our community.

The Orlando Devs Annual Salary Survey has become an annual tradition, with 277 respondents in 2017 (a nearly 50% increase in responses compared to a higher number [than our 2016 survey](/blog/orlando-devs-salaries-in-2016/).

## Compensation and Experience

As expected, the longer a software developer has been employed, the higher their typical salary. It is encouraging to know that our industry compensates professionals based on their experience and the contributions they bring to various industries.

The following visualization excludes some outliers, but tells the same story as above; in general, the longer you've been around, the more youâ€™ll get paid.

**What this means to you:** The future still looks bright in our industry for both new and experienced developers.

---

## Compensation and Gender

The following results were a pleasant surprise for all of us! Junior and mid-level female developers are earning similar salaries as their male counterparts in comparable roles! ðŸ˜Š

Unfortunately, the story changes in senior-level positions. Men are still getting paid more in those jobs. 

<img src="/assets/authors/sergiocruz/2017-salaries/6-pay-by-exp-and-gender.png" class="img-large img-center" alt="Developers compensation by experience level and gender in Orlando, FL in 2017" />

**What this means to you:** Regardless of gender, _now_ is a great time to get started with development.

---

## Annual Salary By College Degree

Do developers need a college degree to do well in their careers? While this graph certainly shows that having a degree helps you earn more money throughout your career, itâ€™s not a must. Self-taught developers arenâ€™t far behind in average compensation. 

On the y-axis, you can see which type of degree was earned and how many respondents there were for each category. For example, most of our survey respondents do not have a college degree in this field (101 people), followed by Computer Science grads (76 people), and so on.

<img src="/assets/authors/sergiocruz/2017-salaries/2-pay-by-degree.png" class="img-large img-center" alt="Average pay of developers by college degree in Orlando, FL in 2017" />

**What this means to you:** If you have the opportunity, you should pursue a college degree. However, developers in our community who do not have one are still doing just fine.

---

## Annual Salary by Primary Coding Language

Does a developer's primary programming language have an impact on their pay? The following graph shows us that the answer is _yes_ ðŸŽŠ ðŸŽ‰.

All in all, it looks like a great time to be alive for iOS developers! However, it made us wonder if higher salaries for Objective-C and Swift developers were related to the total size of the workforce. There were only 19 iOS developer respondents (Objective-C & Swift combined), whereas Java and JavaScript had 24 and 72 respondents respectively. 

<img src="/assets/authors/sergiocruz/2017-salaries/3-pay-by-language.png" class="img-large img-center" alt="Compensation by programming language in Orlando, FL for software developers in 2017" />

**What this means to you:** There isn't a _huge_ difference in pay between languages. At the end of the day, do what you enjoy, but be willing to be flexible and able to wear multiple hats.

---

## Compensation By Satisfaction

Is there a correlation between job satisfaction and compensation? Our next visualization shows us that this seems to be the case, but not by much.

<img src="/assets/authors/sergiocruz/2017-salaries/4-pay-by-satisfaction.png" class="img-large img-center" alt="Correlation between pay and job satisfaction for Orlando, FL developers in 2017" />

**What this means to you:** Although compensation seems to have some influence over how satisfied a developer is with their job, it doesnâ€™t seem to be the only factor. Do things that interest you in your career, as that will ultimately have a bigger payout for you in the future!

---

## Popularity of Languages and Satisfaction Amongst Age Groups

Our next chart shows us that JavaScript is the most popular programming language in our community, followed by PHP, C#, and so on.

Another interesting piece of information in this visualization is that people in the 26-30 age range are pretty unhappy no matter what they're working on (millennials, ya know? ðŸ™ƒ). An exception to this are developers working in Ruby, as it seems to make all age groups happy.

<img src="/assets/authors/sergiocruz/2017-salaries/7-satisfaction.png" class="img-large img-center" alt="Programming language popularity amongst age groups in Orlando, FL in 2017" />

**What this means to you:** Age appears to have some correlation to the type of development stack you'd be happier working with. While you may not yet be able to decide to be a happy 50 year-old C# developer, you may be able to avoid being an unhappy 20-something by not selecting C# as your first development stack and instead choose something more popular among your peers.

---

## Compensation and People Management

Is it true that developers need to become managers to finally have a breakthrough in income? That does not seem to be the case in our community.

<img src="/assets/authors/sergiocruz/2017-salaries/8-pay-and-management.png" class="img-large img-center" alt="Programming language popularity amongst age groups in Orlando, FL in 2017" />

**What this means to you:** Managing people is rewarding in many ways, but you shouldnâ€™t do it just for a salary increase.
