We are the Orlando Devs, a community of software developers in Orlando who are life-long learners and love being around like-minded people all day.

We do that by hanging out on the [Orlando Devs Slack channel]({{ site.baseurl }}/slack) every day, and by going to multiple meetups throughout the month. We even have [our own monthly meetup]({{ site.baseurl }}/meetup) where we cover a wide array of topics that are related to software development.
