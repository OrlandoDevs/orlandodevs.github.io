## The Rules

First and foremost, we take our Code of Conduct very seriously for the safety of our community. Here's a quick summary plus some additional rules relevant to our ongoing online chat:

* Be kind. Don't be a jerk.
* Be helpful to beginners. We all have been a beginner at some point.
* No recruiters. We want this to be a safe, harassment-free place for developers.

### If you don't follow the rules, you will be removed.

Individuals who violate these rules will get a warning before being removed. Please note that we are very reasonable and understanding. Ultimately we're all human beings who make mistakes every now and again. We're also strong believers in second chances.
